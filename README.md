# Pathfinder-Leveling
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT

This will allow Pathfinder players to more easily level up a character.
Currently allows for basic input and output of basic class information including new character creation.

- FUTURE PLANS
- Create database of feats to be used for ease of searching
- Connect with Roll20 API to read and update a character sheet within an existing game
- Expand information beyond basic classes to include all available pathfinder classes/options
